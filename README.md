# Mountain Lakes Research Group Shiny App

This repo contains the material to create the Mountain Lakes Research Group (MLRG) shiny app. Data displayed within the app was collected by researchers who are a part of the MLRG and are located at the Sierra Nevada Aquative Research Laboratory (SNARL). Over 13,000 bodies of water with in the Sierra Nevadas have been surveyed since 1995; with data collected to the individual level for the species of interest. Researchers from the MLRG at SNARL, in partnership with Resilience Institute Bridging Biological and Technological Research (RIBBiTR), an NSF funded institue, have created this app to share their extensive data set with partneres to aid in the monitoring of sensitive species found within the watersheds.
