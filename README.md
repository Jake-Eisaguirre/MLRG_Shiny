# National Park Service Shiny App

This repo contains the material to create the NPS shiny app. Data displayed within the app was collected by researchers at the Sierra Nevada Aquative Research Laboratory (SNARL). Over 7,000 bodies of water with in the Sierra Nevadas have been surveyed since 1995 with data collected to the individual level for the species of interest. Researchers from SNARL, in partnership with Resilience Institute Bridging Biological and Technological Research (RIBBiTR), an NSF funded institue, have created this app to share their extensive data set with the NPS to aid in the monitoring of sensitive species found within the watersheds.
